# üè° StayNest ‚Äì Full Stack Project (MEN Stack + HTML/CSS/JS)

Welcome to my journey of full-stack development project where I build a **fully functional StayNest!  
StayNest is a fully functional web application built from the ground up using the MEN Stack (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) alongside HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for the frontend. This project showcases a complete end-to-end implementation of a vacation rental service, featuring core functionalities such as user authentication, listing creation, booking management, and more
This project leverages the **MEN Stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, Node.js) along with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the frontend (without React).

## üìö Key Concepts and Features Implemented

### üîß Project Setup & Basic CRUD
- Initial project setup and boilerplate
- Listing models and database initialization
- Creating full CRUD routes (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for Listings
- Handling Database operations with Mongoose
- Client-side and server-side form validation

### üé® Frontend Styling
- Responsive design using custom CSS
- Dynamic Navbar and Footer across pages
- Styled pages: Home, Listings Index, New Listing, Edit Listing, Show Listing

### üî• Authentication & Authorization
- User signup, login, logout flows using Passport.js (Local Strategy)
- Password hashing and salting
- User sessions and persistent login with `express-session`
- Flash messages for feedback (success/failure)
- Route protection: Authorization for Listings and Reviews (only owners can edit/delete)

### üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling
- Custom error classes
- Default error pages and user-friendly error messages
- Handling async errors with `wrapAsync` utility

### üõ†Ô∏è Middlewares
- Built multiple custom middlewares
- API token handling through query strings
- Chaining and combining multiple middlewares
- Error-handling middleware (Express standards)

### üó∫Ô∏è Maps Integration (Location & Geocoding)
- Integrated Mapbox for location-based features
- Created interactive maps with markers and popups
- Geocoding service to translate addresses into coordinates
- Store and manage geographic data in MongoDB

### üì∑ Image Uploads
- Allow users to upload listing images
- Used Cloudinary for image storage
- Image preview feature before submission
- Ability to update and delete images associated with listings

### üîÑ MVC Structure
- Refactored into MVC architecture:
  - Models (MongoDB schemas)
  - Views (EJS templates)
  - Controllers (Express route handlers)

### üç™ Cookies and Session Management
- Managed session data with `express-session`
- Used `cookie-parser` for parsing and signing cookies
- Handled flash messaging through session-based flash storage

### üß© Database Relationships
- One-to-many relationships between Users ‚û° Listings
- One-to-many relationships between Listings ‚û° Reviews
- Populate nested documents using Mongoose‚Äôs `populate` method

### ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment
- MongoDB Atlas for cloud database
- Deployed the full stack application on Render
- Continuous deployment connected via GitHub
